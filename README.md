# cassidy

Cassidy is a library for reading and writing SHON documents. SHON stands for Semantic HTML
Object Notation. Broadly speaking, this is a data format (like JSON or XML) that expresses
data using plain old HTML.

The library currently only writes SHON documents. A parser is next on the list of things to do.

## Installation

Still a work in progress.
